# Todo List Application

My first JavaScript project for learning DOM manipulation and localStorage.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete  
- Save tasks to localStorage
- Task counter and clear all button

## What I Learned

**Technical:**
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- localStorage API for data persistence

**Key Insight:**  
While trying to add a filter feature, I discovered my data structure (string array) wasn't suitable for more complex features. This taught me to plan data structure before coding. Applied this lesson in my Weather App project.

## Known Limitations

- Checkbox state doesn't persist (requires data structure refactoring)
- Filter UI is present but not functional

## Tech Stack

JavaScript, HTML, CSS
